description: An application that allows users to track their sweeping in the fine, fine sport of Curling. <br> What is curling? It's a sport that involves a broom, some stones, and a sheet of ice. Sweepers will sweep the ice in front of a thrown stone to try to direct it to a location on the ice sheet. SmartBroom uses some hardware to detect the frequency of the broom's oscillation, and the pressure that the sweeper is using on the ice, then broadcasts it to an Android phone. <br> Improve your game today!
